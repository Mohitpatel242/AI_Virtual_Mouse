AI Virtual Mouse: Hands-free Cursor Control with Python
Project Objective:  Developed an AI-powered virtual mouse that tracks finger movements and translates them into cursor control.

Technical Highlights:
Hand and Finger Detection: Leveraged OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries for real-time hand and fingertip recognition.
Cursor Control: Utilized AutoPy library to map finger movement to precise cursor movements on the screen.
Python Libraries: Implemented a combination of OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, time, and math for image processing and control functionalities.

Key Achievements:
Hands-free mouse control for a more intuitive user experience.
Potential for accessibility applications and improved ergonomics.
